*******************************************************************************

The boot loader uses three interfaces to define and customize its behavior.

Boot Loader IO Interface:

The boot loader IO interface definitions provide control inputs and status
outputs that the boot loader can use to determine when it should load a new
application image and how it should report its status.

Boot Loader Media Interface:

The boot loader media interface definitions provide access to the boot image 
medium and the ability to read the file.

Boot Loader Interface

The Loader interface definitions provide any data translation and Flash 
programming necessary to load the boot image into program Flash memory.

These interface routines can be implemented via macros or functions as 
required.

/****************************************************************************
  Function:
    BOOL BL_ApplicationIsValid ( void )

  Description:
    This function identifies if the application image currently in program
    Flash is valid and ready to be booted.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    TRUE    - If the application image in Flash is valid
    FALSE   - If the application image in Flash is invalid

  Remarks:
    This function can be implemented to validate the image.  If not 
    implemented, then this must always return TRUE or no image will be 
    booted.

/****************************************************************************
  Function:
    void BL_ApplicationFailedToLaunch ( void )

  Description:
    This function will be called after the attempt to boot the application,
    only if the application fails to boot and "returns" to the boot loader.
    It will not be called if the application "boots" successfully.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    None

  Returns:
    None

  Remarks:
    This function can be implemented to provide any desired action or 
    status reporting if the application fails to boot and returns to the
    boot loader.
