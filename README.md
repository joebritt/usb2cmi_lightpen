# usb2cmi_lightpen
Use a USB mouse instead of (or in conjunction with) the lightpen on a Fairlight CMI.

Some work will be needed to get the code to build with the latest Microchip MPLAB X tools,
so I recommend installing the v8.63 release of MPLAB (pre-MPLAB X). 

Microchip is good about making legacy tools available, you can find version 8.63 here:
